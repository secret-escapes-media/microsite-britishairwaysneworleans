intro: New Orleans is a city steeped in history, with idiosyncratic traditions that make for unforgettable experiences. French and Spanish colonial legacies are inherent in the style, language and culture of the city, a remarkably original mix that has always made New Orleans a cultural hotbed. From Plessy to Brown, civil rights have a proud home in the city, still a liberal bastion that takes pride in its diversity. The architecture of the French Quarter, the unique parades of Mardi Gras and Treme Second Lines, and the Voodoo rituals and gris-gris sellers offer travellers a startlingly unique story to unpick.

      title: Café du Monde
      description: A stalwart café that perfectly demonstrates the unique cultural identity of the Crescent City. Alight anytime, for this place is always open, and order the café-au-lait with a plate of beignets. You won’t find much else on the menu anyway, just juice and hot chocolate. The coffee is uniquely brewed with chicory, channeling the Creoles’ resourcefulness during the American Civil War where coffee was very limited. The classic beignets were brought to Louisiana by the Acadians, now known as Cajuns. In a small pit-stop at this famous café, New Orleanian history is served.

      title: St Louis Cemetery No.1
      description: The city’s oldest cemetery, St Louis exudes gothic splendour. The above-ground tombs are lavish, ornate, and a healthy dose of creepy. You’ll find the final resting place of the venerable civil rights activist Homer Plessy alongside a host of other NOLA faces – this also includes Nicolas Cage’s tomb, because he’s really, really odd. Most famously, Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau is purported to rest here, and her grave has become a site of pilgrimage – visitors leave offerings in the hope that Laveau will answer their prayers.

      title: Antoine’s
      description: This historic restaurant is the oldest family restaurant in the USA, serving up high-end French Creole fare. A true New Orleans stalwart, it has hosted many ex-presidents including F.D Roosevelt, and esteemed guests like Pope John Paul II. It was here that Oysters Rockefeller and Eggs Sardou were invented, Prohibition was skirted around (ask about the mystery room) and over a century of old Orleans history is waiting to be feasted upon.

      title: Euclid Records
      description: What better way to explore the cultural history of NOLA, and potentially walk away with your own artefact, than to dig and dig and dig through stacks of dusty records? Head over to the pink-fronted Euclid Records, and tuck-in to crates loaded with Treme brass singles and forgotten jazz bands. This community record store also runs a 45RPM series which donates to the New Orleans Musicians Relief Fund – a worthwhile cause that makes this a must-visit.

      title: Backstreet Cultural Museum
      description: This eccentric museum is a perfect spot to learn about New Orleans’ fascinating culture. From Second Lines, Jazz Funerals, Mardi Gras and the Skull and Bones Gang, the Backstreet Cultural Museum takes you through a vibrant collection of artefacts. Learn about the struggle against oppression by African-Americans, and the birth of the vivacious Treme neighbourhood. Quite possibly the best museum to discover the real New Orleans.
