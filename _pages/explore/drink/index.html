      title: Carousel Bar
      description: Hotel bar, literary landmark, beset with rotating carousel bar and the birthplace of two cocktails – an unmissable stop for sure. The spectacle befits the fevered lives of the four great Modern writers mentioned above, who all drank here – Capote even uttering he was born here. The Vieux Carré and The Goody were invented here, so pitch up and revolve around a Nola stalwart.

      title: Sazerac Bar
      description: The city’s most famous alcoholic export, the Sazerac is one of the oldest and most famous cocktails there is – and here’s the bar that invented it. Well, loosely anyway. It was actually based off a popular concoction that pharmacist Antoine Peychaud created, which the Sazerac Bar bought the rights to, updated, and turned into the most famous of Nola cocktails. Step into this Art-Deco timewarp and sip.

      title: Old Absinthe House
      description: Over 200 years of kitsch saloon-style cocktail goodness permeate the old-world interior of this Bourbon St stalwart. As the name helpfully suggests, Absinthe reigns supreme here, with the original wooden bar still sporting the copper faucets used to drip water into the vibrant green concoction. Enjoy the bar’s signature, the Absinthe House Frappe, as you imagine patrons like Oscar Wilde, PT Barnum, Mark Twain (and plenty more) hallucinating dancing green fairies on the aged stools.

      description: Representing the burgeoning craft-cocktail scene that has subtly reinvented Nola’s nightlife, is this proto-tiki nightspot. With no signage outside to signal arrival, this chic hangout oozes speakeasy vibes with Caribbean flair. Try the Boss Colada, packed with a heady concoction of fresh pineapple and lime, Baska Snäps and Peychaud’s Bitters.

      title: Gene’s Curbside Daiquiris
      description: This kitsch spot may not ooze masterful mixology, but the frozen daiquiris here are a potent antidote to the sweltering Nola heat. Not a bar, but a shop, pop in and order what can only be described as a jug of the good stuff, in all its sweet, icy, booze-packed glory. 24 hour service is a potentially dangerous suggestion, but should you need to soak it all up, Gene’s PoBoys is right round the corner.
