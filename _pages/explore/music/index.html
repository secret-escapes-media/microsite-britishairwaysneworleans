intro: Jazz is the lifeblood of New Orleans, a vehicle that describes the jubilant, playful nature of the city. A tapestry of cultural influences came together to create the style; sharp European brass mixed with African folk drumming creating a heady, rhythmic sound that promoted swing and improv. Slaves under Spanish occupation were permitted Sunday’s off, so they gathered in Congo Square to beat the heat, socialise, and play music. This was suppressed under American rule, but the practice stuck allowing African-American rhythms to persevere. Now, music is played morning, day and night, soaking the city in melody and soundtracking the lives of joyous New Orleanians.

      description: Jive and swing at this cool, intimate club. With a shabby-chic interior that sets the vintage-kitsch tone for the evening, roll up and sink a few beers (you’ll struggle to get a cocktail here) before grabbing your partner for a jive on the floor. With renowned contemporary jazz faces a regular fixture, the quality of the music is great – with no add-on frills or cover charge to distract from the music or the dancing.

      description: At the very end of the Bywater, this hip local’s hangout is a buzzing spot for whiling away a warm NOLA night in good company. It’s a hidden spot well-off the tourist path, where in-the-know Orleanians come for the open-air seating, fine wine-and-cheese selection and impeccable live music. A bicycle or taxi is the best way to head over – the short trip is well worth it.

      title: Preservation Hall
      description: Faded wooden walls hint at the musical history that permeates this coveted jazz hangout. Set up in the ‘60s to preserve traditional jazz, Preservation Hall is NOLA’s favourite evening jazz spot. At 8, 9 or 10pm, queues form to catch the house band perform. Get in that queue and prepare to catch the spirit of New Orleans, played out by the quaking French horn to the thundering snare. It’s mostly standing room and BYOB, so be sure to bring a bottle. Audience participation positively encouraged!
