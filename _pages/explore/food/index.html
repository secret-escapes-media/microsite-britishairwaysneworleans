      title: Mother’s
      description: The stalwart diner Mother’s is usually decorated by a lively queue of hungry visitors. It serves up healthy portions of brunch staples in true American diner style, with plenty of southern classics like red beans and rice, PoBoys and fried chicken to satisfy your appetite. The Ferdi Special, a gloriously overstuffed PoBoy packed with their famous baked ham, roast beef and debris (Mother’s invented the debris!) and served dressed, is a perfect lunchtime gut buster. The interior is packed with trinkets and memorabilia, with warm hospitality set to offer you the fascinating history of this place. The bread pudding is to die for.

      title: Dooky Chase’s
      description: Ask any local whether they’ve eaten at Dooky Chase’s and you’ll be greeted with a unanimous and enthusiastic yes. In the heart of Treme, owner and chef Leah Chase (now in her 90s and still cooking!) serves up classic southern Creole fare, with world famous fried chicken and other local staples. It’s soul food at its finest, only matched in quality by its illustrious history. It became a pivotal meeting place for civil rights activists, breaking Jim Crow segregation laws and getting away with it – there was a fear that shutting down the restaurant would start a riot, such was its popularity. Ray Charles even wrote a song about it – at this point, you should already have added it to your itinerary.

      title: Cochon
      description: Tucked in the cool Warehouse District, Cochon is a mecca for meat lovers. Chef Donald Link reinvents his Cajun background with a contemporary flair that smokes, roasts, shreds and cures, well, pork mainly. Swine aside, there’s enough to suit any choosy diner – beef, oysters and more make Cochon a coveted Warehouse favourite, with typical industrial-chic design that makes this a hip dinner spot sure to leave you satisfied.

      title: Killer Po’Boys
      description: Another forward-looking kitchen turning classic Nola bites on their head, Killer Po’Boys set up their hipster shop in the back of the Erin Rose bar. Forget the classic French bread, locally backed Banh Mi rolls supports fillings all locally sourced, and creatively prepared. No beef or sausage here, instead such mouth-watering creations as the Dark & Stormy Pork Belly with locally made rum intensifying the ginger maple glaze on the pig. Killer Po’Boys no doubt.

      title: Bywater American Bistro
      description: Nina Compton is a local celebrity in New Orleans – her first venture in the Warehouse District, Compere Lapin, is a roaring success. So this intimate bistro in trendy Bywater is an interesting development. It’s far more ‘neighbourhood’, complementing the quieter, more residential area it occupies. It therefore feels very much a tucked away gem – all before you’ve even sampled the incredible food that’s made Compton’s name so recognised. Local Creole and Cajun flavours mix with Compton’s Caribbean heritage, offering a glorious contemporary fusion of bold flavours – irresistibly fitting to such a dynamic city.
