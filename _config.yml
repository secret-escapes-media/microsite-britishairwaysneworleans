title: British Airways New Orleans
description: Voodoo sounds echo across syncopated Second Lines, where a riot of colour skips across the Mardis Gras headdresses and the balconies and bright facades of the French Quarter’s townhouses. Southern hospitality abounds from down-to-earth eateries and eclectic dive-bars, where Creole flavours spice the gumbo, PoBoys and red beans and rice. High-society hotel-bars mix drinks of worldwide renown alongside jazz bars that spill out frantic melodies in a vivacious flurry of excitement – New Orleans is a hot, frenetic, but above all joyous concoction of vivacity, pride, and liberty.
